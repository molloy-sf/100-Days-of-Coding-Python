# Calculator

This is a simple calculator program written in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program features a user-friendly interface and supports continuous calculations until the user decides to stop.

## Features

- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Continuously calculate using the result of the previous operation
- Clear and intuitive user interface

## Installation

To run the calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone this repository or download the code files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries (if any) using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install art

Usage

    Open a terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory containing the calculator.py file.

    Run the script:

    bash

    python calculator.py

    Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations.

Example

When prompted, you can enter the first number, select an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /), and then enter the second number. The program will display the result and ask if you'd like to continue with that result or start a new calculation.

python

What is the first number?: 5
+
-
*
/
Select an operation: +
What is the next number?: 3
5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 8.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n

Functions

    add(n1, n2): Returns the sum of n1 and n2.
    subtract(n1, n2): Returns the difference when n2 is subtracted from n1.
    multiply(n1, n2): Returns the product of n1 and n2.
    divide(n1, n2): Returns the quotient of n1 divided by n2.
